# PowerBI-DataProfessionalSurveyInsight
This repository hosts a Power BI project centred around analyzing a survey conducted within the data professional community.
This repository features my final Power BI project, part of a tutorial series by Alex the Analyst.
Utilizing data provided by Alex's GitHub page, this project served as a practical learning experience in Power BI.

Objective: The project aimed to extract meaningful insights from a dataset sourced from active data analyst professionals via a reputable YouTube channel, focusing on distilling valuable intelligence.

Data Processing: Employed Power BI Power Query Editor to systematically clean and preprocess the raw dataset, ensuring its optimal quality for subsequent analysis within Power BI.

Visualizations: Developed a range of visualizations, including bar charts, stacked column charts, gauge charts, and more. These visuals unveiled key insights into metrics like average salary distributions, workplace satisfaction rates, and the nuanced relationship between geographical locations and salary trends. These visual representations were crucial for informed decision-making and strategic analysis.
